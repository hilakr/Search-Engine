Remember those walls I built? 
Well, baby they are tumbling down 
And they didn앖 even put up a fight 
They didn앖 even make a sound 
I found a way to let you in 
But, I never really had a doubt 
Standing in the light of your halo 
I got my angel now 

It압 like I았e been awakened 
Every rule I had you breaking 
it압 the risk that I앐 taking 
I ain앖 never gonna shut you out! 

Everywhere I앐 looking now 
I앐 surrounded by your embrace 
Baby, I can see your halo 
You know youre my saving grace 
youre everything I need and more 
it압 written all over your face 
Baby, I can feel your halo 
Pray it won't fade away 

I can feel your halo 
I can see your halo 
I can feel your halo 
I can see your halo 
Halo, ooh ooh..... 

Hit me like a ray of sun 
Burning through my darkest night 
youre the only one that I want 
Think I앐 addicted to your light 
I swore I앇 never fall again 
But this don앖 even feel like falling 
Gravity can앖 forget 
To pull me back to the ground again 

It압 like I았e been awakened 
Every rule I had you breaking 
it압 the risk that I앐 taking 
I앐 never gonna shut you out! 

Everywhere I앐 looking now 
I앐 surrounded by your embrace 
Baby, I can feel your halo 
I pray it won't fade away 

I can feel your halo 
I can see your halo 
I can feel your halo 
I can see your halo 
Halo, ooh ooh..... 
I can feel your halo 
I can see your halo 
I can feel your halo 
I can see your halo 
Halo, ooh ooh..... 
Halo, ooh ooh..... 
Halo, ooh ooh, ooooh........ 

Everywhere I앐 looking now 
I앐 surrounded by your embrace 
Baby, I can see your halo 
You know youre my saving grace 
youre everything I need and more 
it압 written all over your face 
Baby, I can feel your halo 
I pray it won't fade away 

I can feel your halo 
I can see your halo 
I can feel your halo 
I can see your halo 
Halo, ooh oooh....... 
I can feel your halo 
I can see your halo 
I can feel your halo 
I can see your halo 
Halo, ooh oooh.......
